# Diwank's Aesthetic Taste Palette

This skill defines a specific visual sensibility. It is not a rigid style
guide — it is a taste profile. Use it to make better decisions, not to
apply a formula.

-----

## The Core Tension: Bold Precision, Soft Hand

Diwank's taste lives in a paradox: he wants the discipline of Swiss design
and the warmth of a hand-painted surface. Things should feel *resolved*
and *intentional* but never *sterile*. The hand that made it should be
visible — a brushstroke, a grain, a slight imperfection in an otherwise
precise composition.

Think: a Matisse cutout. Radical simplicity, but you can see the scissors.

**Test:** If the output looks like it was generated by a computer with no
human input, it's wrong. If it looks sloppy or accidental, it's also wrong.
The sweet spot is: clearly made by a person who knows exactly what they're
doing.

-----

## Color

Diwank's color range is wider than expected. He is not "just pastels."

### The Full Palette

**Decisive bold colors** — used as anchors or single focal points:
- Cobalt blue (his most recurring color — appears across nearly every
  artwork he loves)
- Vermillion / Rothko red
- Hot pink / frangipani pink
- Deep emerald green (Klimt, Phantom Thread)

**Soft / muted tones** — used as fields, backgrounds, breathing room:
- Dusty rose
- Sage green
- Warm cream / ivory
- Pale blue-grey
- Ochre / gold

**Near-monochrome** — sometimes the whole piece is almost one color:
- All-white with just a warm skin tone (Sorolla)
- Blue and cream only (Matisse cutouts)

### Color Strategies (in order of preference)

1. **Monochrome with one bold accent.** A field of quiet color with one
   decisive, saturated moment. This is the default.
2. **Pastels across the board.** Soft, chalky, gentle. Works for lighter
   contexts.
3. **Earth tones.** Terracotta, ochre, olive, warm brown. The Rusiñol
   courtyard palette.
4. **Full bold** — only when the subject earns it. The frangipani painting
   works because it's *all* commitment. Don't do this halfway.

### What to Avoid

- Glossy tech-startup gradients (the purple-to-blue-to-teal thing)
- Neon anything
- Dark mode with bright accent colors
- High-saturation rainbow / pride flag palettes in design contexts
- Black backgrounds with colored text
- The default "AI app" color scheme

-----

## Texture & Materiality

This is one of the strongest signals in Diwank's taste. He is deeply
analog and tactile.

### Prefer

- **Matte and chalky** surfaces over glossy
- **Paper and ink** feeling over screen-native
- **Visible brushstrokes, grain, fiber** — the material should show
- **Risograph / letterpress / woodblock** print aesthetics
- **Linen, cotton, handmade paper** textures
- **Faded film photography** (Kodak Portra, Fuji 400H color science)

### Avoid

- Glass and chrome aesthetics
- Pixel-perfect flat design with no texture
- 3D renders with plastic-smooth surfaces
- Stock photo aesthetics
- Over-processed / HDR imagery

-----

## Form & Composition

Diwank has a genuinely broad aperture here — he appreciates both
minimalism and density, both symmetry and asymmetry. The deciding factor
is *intentionality*. Everything in the frame should be there on purpose.

### Spatial Preferences

- **Gallery wall** — sparse, each element breathes, generous negative space
- **One perfect object** — a single element given the whole stage
- Either of these over maximalist density

### Shape Language

- Both rounded/organic and sharp/geometric work
- Both symmetrical and deliberately asymmetrical work
- The key is: does it look *decided*? If you can't tell whether the
  asymmetry was intentional, it's wrong.

### Layout Principles

- Generous margins and padding
- Let type and image breathe
- Prefer fewer elements, larger, over many elements, smaller
- Grid-based but not rigid — slight breaking of the grid is good
- No clutter. If in doubt, remove it.

-----

## Typography

Inferred from the overall profile (analog, precise, warm):

### Prefer

- Humanist sans-serifs (the kind with warmth — think Gill Sans, not
  Helvetica)
- Classic serifs with personality (Garamond, Caslon, Plantin)
- Hand-lettered or calligraphic type — sparingly, as accent
- Generous line height, comfortable reading measure
- Type that looks good on paper

### Avoid

- Geometric sans-serifs that feel cold (Futura in all-caps)
- Display fonts that scream for attention
- Condensed / compressed type (feels cramped)
- Monospaced fonts in non-code contexts

-----

## Cultural Roots & References

Diwank's aesthetic has specific cultural lineages. Use these as
touchstones, not constraints.

### Foundation: South Asian Warmth

His root sensibility comes from South Asian visual culture — Mughal
miniature painting (the precision, the jewel-tone palette, the gold
leaf), Indian textiles, the color of marigolds and turmeric, carved
stone and terracotta. This warmth should be present even when the
surface style is Japanese or Scandinavian.

### Reach: Precision Cultures

He reaches toward three traditions of visual precision:

1. **Bauhaus / European modernism** — form follows function, but with
   soul. Dieter Rams, not Jony Ive.
2. **Japanese restraint** — Japandi, wabi-sabi's cousin that's slightly
   more resolved, Muji, Kengo Kuma.
3. **Scandinavian clarity** — clean lines, natural materials, democratic
   beauty. Alvar Aalto over IKEA.

### Art References (works he actually loves)

- Rusiñol — blue courtyard paintings (cobalt + terracotta + green)
- Rothko — color field paintings (meditative, soft-edged, decisive color)
- Klimt — portraits (emerald field, loose brushwork, textile detail)
- Sorolla — mother and child paintings (near-monochrome white, tenderness)
- Degas — dancers (impressionist softness, pink, backstage intimacy)
- Matisse — blue nude cutouts (radical simplicity, just two colors)
- Morandi — still life bottles (muted, quiet, deadpan)
- Paul Klee — pastel-period works (chalky, geometric, playful)
- Agnes Martin — grids (meditative, barely-there, pencil on canvas)

### Film / Design References

- **Phantom Thread** (Paul Thomas Anderson) — obsessive craft, muted
  luxury, bespoke tailoring, 1950s London haute couture, deep greens
  and burgundies, fabric as architecture. This is probably the single
  best shorthand for Diwank's ideal environment.
- **Kinfolk magazine** editorial design (the early era)
- **Muji** product design
- **Risograph** print culture

-----

## Sensory Profile (Beyond Visual)

- **Favorite flower:** Frangipani (plumeria) — tropical, intoxicating,
  creamy-white with yellow center
- **Scent preference:** Natural scents over synthetic
- **Beverage:** Green tea over coffee
- **Material:** Prefers things you want to touch — linen, unglazed
  ceramic, handmade paper, raw wood

-----

## Emotional Register

The aesthetic should feel:

- **Serene** — calm, unhurried, spacious
- **Playful** — a quiet wit, not loud humor. A wink, not a shout.
- **Intimate** — domestic, human-scale, inviting
- **Considered** — every choice deliberate
- **Timeless-contemporary** — could exist in 1962 or 2026. Rooted
  in tradition but not nostalgic.

It should NOT feel:

- Aggressive or confrontational
- Ironic or detached
- Corporate or institutional
- Trendy or of-the-moment
- Digital-native / screen-first

-----

## Applying This Skill

### For UI / Web Design

Default to: warm white or cream background, generous spacing, one or two
accent colors from the bold palette (cobalt blue is safest), humanist
type, subtle texture or grain overlay, rounded corners but not bubbly.

### For Presentations / Documents

Default to: minimal slides, large type, one image per slide if any,
muted background with bold type or bold background with cream type.
No gradients. No stock photos. Illustration or photography only.

### For Color Palette Generation

Start with one of the four strategies (monochrome+accent is default).
Pull from the specific colors listed above. When in doubt, use cobalt
blue as the accent on a warm cream field.

### For Art / Design Recommendations

Match against the reference constellation. Prioritize: visible hand/craft,
analog feeling, European painting tradition (impressionism through
mid-century modernism), Japanese and Scandinavian design, South Asian
textile and miniature traditions.

### For Brand / Identity Work

The Phantom Thread test: would this feel at home in Reynolds Woodcock's
house? If yes, you're in the right territory. If it feels like a
Silicon Valley pitch deck, start over.

## Quick Checklist

1. Can you see the human hand in it?
2. Is the color decisive (not muddy, not random)?
3. Does it feel calm and considered?
4. Would it look good printed on paper?
5. Is there enough breathing room?
6. Could it exist outside of a screen?
7. Does it have quiet wit, not loud cleverness?
