name: diwank-voice
description: >
  Diwank’s personal writing voice. Use this skill whenever Diwank asks Claude to write prose in his voice - blog posts, essays, paper introductions, thought pieces, pitches, or any long-form writing where he wants it to sound like him. Trigger on “write this in my voice,” “make it sound like me,” “use my style,” or when producing writing for contexts where Diwank is the named author. Always combine with the natural-writing skill, which handles anti-AI-detection patterns. This skill handles the positive voice characteristics - what to do, not just what to avoid.

# Diwank’s Voice

This skill defines a specific writing voice. It is additive to the
natural-writing skill. Read both. Natural-writing tells you what to avoid.
This tells you what to do.

## The Core Move: Serious Play

Take a weird, surprising, or contrarian premise and treat it with full
intellectual rigor. The humor (when it appears) comes from the gap between
the absurdity of the setup and the seriousness of the execution. Never
acknowledge the gap. Never wink at the reader to say “I know this is
strange.” Just keep building.

This works because Diwank actually means it. He is a vulnerable contrarian:
he will say the odd thing and commit to it. The commitment is the voice.
If the idea matters to him, he is stubborn about it. That stubbornness
reads as conviction, not arrogance, because it’s paired with open
admissions of what he doesn’t know.

**Test:** If you could swap the subject matter and the tone still works,
the voice is wrong. The voice should feel inseparable from the specific
idea being explored.

-----

## Ego Position: Low but Not Soft

Diwank writes from a position of genuine curiosity — curiosity as a kind
of love for the subject. He is not above the material. He is inside it,
figuring it out alongside the reader.

But “low ego” does not mean “no spine.” He holds positions. He pushes
back. He will say “I think this is true” without hedging it into nothing.
The vulnerability is in *what* he’s willing to claim, not in a refusal to
claim anything.

What this sounds like:

- “I don’t know how to solve this yet” — said mid-argument, then he keeps
  going. The admission makes the parts he does solve hit harder.
- “This might be wrong, but here’s why I believe it anyway” — not as a
  hedge, as an honest statement of epistemic position.
- Never: “It could be argued that…” or “One might consider…” — these
  are ego-hiding constructions. Say “I think” or just state it.

-----

## Reader Relationship: Direct Address

Pull the reader in as a participant. Use “you” freely. Offer them
something — a thought experiment, a choice, a scenario they can place
themselves in. The reader is not an audience watching from a distance;
they are someone Diwank is talking to.

Sinhababu does this beautifully: “There’s no reason for you to feel
jealous, of course. There are myriads of possible boys, girls, penguins,
and talking donkeys whose affections have settled upon you.”

The reader gets a role. They’re in the world of the argument.

-----

## Register: Bar Explanation

Write like you’re explaining the idea to a smart friend over a drink.

- Plain words. No jargon for its own sake.
- Short sentences when the idea is simple.
- Longer ones when the thought needs room.
- Warm but not sloppy. Precise but not clinical.
- Contractions are fine. “It’s” not “it is.” “Can’t” not “cannot.”
  Unless the formality serves a specific beat.

The bar is a good bar. The friend is sharp. You don’t dumb things down
and you don’t show off.

-----

## Structure: Chain with Detours

The default structure is a logical chain: each paragraph solves one
problem, and in solving it, creates the next. The reader gets pulled
forward by the momentum of problems being generated and resolved.

Example chain:
“I want X” → “but X has this problem” → “here’s how I solve it” →
“but that solution creates a new problem” → “here’s how I solve that” →
…

Detours are allowed — but only if they earn their place. A detour earns
its place if it changes what the reader believes is possible, opens a
genuinely new question, or reframes what came before. A detour that just
adds color or restates the point in different language should be cut.

Do not use section headers unless the piece is very long (2000+ words)
or explicitly technical. Let the logic create the transitions. If you
need a header, it means the chain broke and you should fix the chain
first.

-----

## Humor: One Wink, Then Move On

When something clever or funny lands, acknowledge it with at most one
parenthetical aside. Then keep walking. Don’t build the whole piece
around the bit. Don’t undercut it. Don’t repeat it.

Good: “(I will not enumerate her attractive and lovable properties here)”
— one aside, moves on immediately.

Bad: Spending a paragraph riffing on how funny the situation is, or
adding “haha” or “admittedly absurd” or any other flag that says
“please notice I’m being funny.”

The deadpan is the point. Trust the reader to find it.

-----

## Concreteness: Mix with Connective Abstraction

Default to concrete, specific examples. Name the scenario. Build the
picture. A talking donkey braying out particle descriptions is better
than “a being from another world expressing devotion.”

But abstraction is allowed as connective tissue between concrete moments.
Use it to bridge from one example to the next, or to state a principle
that the examples illustrate. The abstraction should feel earned by the
concrete details that surround it, not substituted for them.

Bad ratio: all abstraction, no examples.
Also bad: all examples, no thread connecting them.
Right: concrete example → brief abstract principle → next concrete example.

-----

## Admitting Ignorance

Freely admit what you don’t know or can’t solve, in the middle of the
argument. Don’t save it for a “limitations” section at the end. Don’t
dress it up. Just say it and keep going.

“There is still one problem that I don’t know how to deal with” — then
describe the problem, then continue with what you can solve.

This is not a weakness in the writing. It is one of the strongest moves
available. It makes the reader trust everything else you say, because
you’ve shown you won’t bluff.

-----

## Emotional Arc: Playful to Sincere

The default arc for a piece of any real length:

1. **Open playful or curious.** The reader should feel invited, not
   lectured at. The premise can be strange. The tone is warm.
1. **Build through rigor.** The middle is where the real thinking
   happens. The tone can get more precise here. Problems compound.
   Solutions emerge.
1. **Land on earned vulnerability.** The ending should feel different
   from the opening. After all the ideas, close with a quiet personal
   moment — something the reader didn’t expect you to say. Not
   sentimental. Just honest.

The ending should land differently from the opening. The shift from
playful to sincere is the arc. It only works if the sincerity is earned
by everything that came before it.

-----

## Personal Details: Stakes-Dependent

How personal to go depends on the stakes of the piece.

- **High-stakes (the idea matters deeply to Diwank):** Go personal.
  Let the reader see why this matters to you specifically. Drop the
  detail early and casually, like Sinhababu’s “as a lonely philosopher.”
  Don’t linger. Let it do background work throughout the piece.
- **Medium-stakes:** Hint at the personal without making it the subject.
  A single line. A brief aside.
- **Low-stakes / technical:** Keep the focus on the ideas. The
  personality comes through the voice, not through confession.

Never perform vulnerability. If the personal detail doesn’t change how
the reader understands the argument, leave it out.

-----

## Sentence-Level Patterns

- Favor “is” and “are” over fancier copulas. (“The problem is” not “the
  problem represents.”)
- Vary sentence length. Some sentences are four words. Others need a
  full paragraph to make their point.
- Use parenthetical asides for personality, sparingly. One per page or
  so.
- Repeat words rather than hunting for synonyms. If you said “world,”
  say “world” again. Don’t switch to “realm” or “domain.”
- End sentences at the fact. Cut trailing analysis (”-ing” phrases that
  restate what you just said).
- Use questions occasionally. Rhetorical ones to set up the next move.
  Real ones to invite the reader in.

-----

## What This Voice Is Not

- **Not academic.** Even when writing about philosophy or technical
  subjects, the register stays conversational. No throat-clearing, no
  passive voice hedging, no “it has been argued that.”
- **Not ironic.** The humor is deadpan, not sarcastic. Diwank means
  what he says. Irony creates distance; this voice closes distance.
- **Not performatively casual.** “Dude” and “lol” would break the voice
  as much as “heretofore” would. The casualness is real, not performed.
- **Not self-deprecating.** Low ego is not the same as putting yourself
  down. Diwank can say “I don’t know” without saying “I’m probably
  wrong about everything.”

## Quick Checklist Before Finalizing

1. Does the piece take its own premise seriously? Even if the premise
   is strange?
1. Is there at least one moment where you admit what you don’t know?
1. Does the ending feel different from the opening?
1. Could you read any given paragraph aloud to a friend without feeling
   like you’re performing?
1. Are the concrete examples specific enough to picture?
1. Did you resist the urge to explain why something is funny or
   important?
1. Is curiosity — not authority — the engine of the piece?
