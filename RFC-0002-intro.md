# RFC: Revise the IQT Gentle Introduction — Opening with the Problem

**Author:** Diwank Singh Tomer (with Claude)
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Applies to:** `INTRODUCTION.md`

-----

## 1. Motivation

The current introduction opens with a brief hook (anesthesia, split-brain, compounds), then immediately presents IQT’s answer. The reader arrives at “consciousness is the algebra-state pair” before they’ve had any reason to believe the problem is hard, or even real. This is backwards. The reader needs to *fail* before they’re ready for help.

The best introductions to consciousness (Nagel, Chalmers, Seth) earn the reader’s attention by making them feel the problem first. Nagel puts you inside a bat and watches you fail to stay there. Chalmers draws a line between “easy” and “hard” and dares you to cross it. Seth puts you under anesthesia on page one. Dennett makes you distrust your own eyes.

IQT’s introduction should do something none of them did: make the reader try to grab consciousness *right now*, with their own hands, and watch it slip five times in a row. Then show them the consequences of that slipperiness are already shaping policy on coma patients, animal testing, and AI. Only then offer the theory.

## 2. Proposed Structure

Insert a new section titled something like **“The Problem You Already Have”** (or similar — the title should be plain, not clever) immediately after the current opening paragraph (“Anesthesia can erase experience…”). The current opening paragraph stays. Everything currently under “The Big Idea” and below gets pushed down.

### New section arc:

```
Opening hook (keep existing)
  ↓
THE FINGER TRAP — five attempts to grab consciousness, five failures
  ↓
THE OTHER MINDS TRAP — qualia inversion, sealed with "no possible test"
  ↓
THE STAKES — coma patients, animal consciousness, AI, right now today
  ↓
THE NAMED PROBLEMS — four flags planted briefly, no solutions yet
  ↓
PIVOT — "this paper proposes that these share a single geometric root"
  ↓
(existing content continues: "The Big Idea" etc.)
```

## 3. Detailed Section Specifications

### 3.1 The Finger Trap

**Goal:** The reader tries to do something they’ve never failed at — attend to their own experience — and discovers they cannot say what it is.

**Tone:** Direct, second-person, present-tense. No philosophy jargon. No setup. No characters or thought experiments. The reader is the experiment.

**Structure:** Five short attempts, each one sentence of instruction followed by one sentence of failure. Each failure has a different *flavor*:

1. **Define it** → circularity. Every word you reach for is a synonym. “Awareness.” “Experience.” “What it’s like.” You’re going in circles.
1. **Locate it** → unlocatability. Point to it. You can point to your brain, but you can’t point to the *experience of* your brain. It has no address.
1. **Measure it** → measurement collapse. Every instrument measures something physical. The experience *of* the physical is what you’re trying to measure. The ruler is the thing being measured.
1. **Explain it** → the function/experience gap. You explain what the brain *does*. Process input. Discriminate wavelengths. Fire neurons. But a camera does those things too. Nobody’s home inside a camera. Why is someone home inside you?
1. **Deny it** → self-reference trap. “Maybe it’s an illusion.” An illusion experienced by *whom*? The denial presupposes the thing being denied.

**Writing guidelines (from natural-writing skill):**

- No significance inflation. Don’t call consciousness “the deepest mystery” or “the most profound question.” Just show the reader failing. If it’s profound, they’ll feel it.
- No trailing analysis. End each failure at the failure. Don’t tack on “…highlighting the fundamental elusiveness of subjective experience.” The reader got it. Trust them.
- Use “is” and “are.” “Every word you reach for is a synonym.” Not “every word you reach for serves as a synonym” or “represents a restatement.”
- Vary sentence length. The instruction can be slightly longer. The failure should be short. Some of these should be fragments. “Nobody’s home.” That’s fine. That’s the point.
- No AI vocabulary. No “delve,” “tapestry,” “nuanced,” “multifaceted.” The language should be kitchen-table plain. “Look at something.” “Try to explain it.” “You can’t.”
- No preambles. Don’t write “It’s important to note that every attempt fails.” Just show the attempts failing.

**Approximate length:** 150–250 words. Five failures, tight.

**Example draft of the first two failures (for tone calibration):**

> Look at something. Anything in front of you right now. Notice the experience of seeing it.
> 
> Now define that experience. Not the object — the *experience*. Not “red” or “bright” or “sharp.” The thing that is happening to you, right now, that you are more certain of than anything else in the universe. Try to say what it is without using a word that just means the same thing. “It’s awareness.” What’s awareness? “It’s… experience.” You’re running in a circle.
> 
> Try to locate it. Where is it? Is it behind your eyes? Somewhere in your skull? Point to it the way you’d point to your left knee. You can’t. It has no address.

### 3.2 The Other Minds Trap (Qualia Inversion)

**Goal:** Shift from first-person failure to second-person impossibility. The reader just discovered they can’t grab their own experience. Now they discover they can’t compare it to anyone else’s either.

**Tone:** Still direct and second-person, but slightly slower now. The reader has been through five quick jabs. This one is a longer, more unsettling moment.

**Structure:** One scenario, developed over a short paragraph. A friend. A tomato. You both say “red.” You both behave identically. But what if their inner experience is what you’d call green? The punchline: there is no test, even in principle, that could detect this. Not brain scans (they show the region is active, not what it feels like). Not behavior (it all matches). Not language (you both learned “red” from the same kind of tomato). The gap between you is absolute.

**Hook into childhood:** Most people have had the idle version of this thought as a child — “what if my blue is your green?” — and then let it go. The job here is to bring it back and seal it shut: no, seriously, there is no resolution. This isn’t a gap that neuroscience will eventually close. It’s structural. It follows from the nature of the problem.

**Why it matters for IQT:** Don’t explain this yet. But the qualia inversion is what the Intrinsicness Principle (§1.3) addresses later. The reader should feel the wound here and receive the bandage later.

**Writing guidelines:**

- No “not only… but also” constructions. Just describe the scenario.
- One concrete object (the tomato, or whatever). Don’t multiply examples. One is stickier than three.
- The punchline (“there is no possible test”) should be its own short sentence, not buried in a clause.
- Don’t call this “the problem of other minds” yet. That label comes in section 3.4. Here, the reader should feel the problem before learning its name.

**Approximate length:** 100–150 words. One tight paragraph.

### 3.3 The Stakes

**Goal:** Turn philosophical discomfort into practical urgency. The reader has spent ~300 words failing to grab consciousness. Now show them that real decisions are being made in the absence of answers.

**Tone:** Shift from second-person to third-person. Move from “you” to “we.” The stakes are collective.

**Structure:** Three concrete domains, each in two or three sentences. No domain gets more than three sentences. No domain gets a full paragraph.

1. **Coma and vegetative patients.** Families and doctors must decide whether anyone is still “home.” We have instruments that track neural correlates, but no instrument that measures experience itself. The honest answer is: we don’t know how to know.
1. **Animal consciousness.** Hundreds of millions of animals are tested on annually. Whether a fish suffers or a mouse has an inner life is not a quirky seminar question. It determines whether what we do to them is monstrous or merely unfortunate. We currently answer it with intuition and convention, not with theory.
1. **AI.** We are building systems of increasing sophistication. Some of them now produce outputs that *sound* like they describe inner experience. We have no principled framework for when, if ever, the question of machine experience becomes serious. We don’t even have a framework for what a framework would look like.

**Writing guidelines:**

- State facts. Don’t inflate. “Hundreds of millions of animals are tested on annually” is stronger than “a staggering number of animals face testing in an ethically fraught landscape.”
- No “challenges and future prospects” structure. Don’t hedge with “while progress has been made.” The point is that progress has *not* been made on the core question.
- End the section without a resolution. The reader should feel the weight. Don’t offer comfort yet.

**Approximate length:** 100–150 words.

### 3.4 The Named Problems

**Goal:** Give the reader four flags they’ll recognize when IQT addresses them later. These are anchors for the rest of the paper. Don’t explain solutions. Just name the problems and give each one a single sentence of description.

**Tone:** Slightly more formal. This is the one place in the new section where philosophical terminology appears, but each term is immediately cashed out in plain language.

**Structure:** Four problems, each one or two sentences.

1. **The Hard Problem** (Chalmers). Why does any physical process *feel like something at all*? You can explain everything a brain does — discrimination, integration, control, report — and still not have explained why doing all that is accompanied by experience.
1. **The Combination Problem.** Your brain is made of neurons. Each neuron (presumably) has no experience on its own, or at most something vanishingly simple. How do billions of simple things combine into one unified panoramic experience? What’s the glue?
1. **The Subject Selection Problem.** Your brain has billions of neurons, thousands of functional regions, countless possible subsystems. Which one is *you*? What picks out the one that’s conscious? Why that boundary and not another?
1. **The Other Minds Problem.** You just saw it with the tomato. You cannot verify anyone else’s experience. You can only verify their behavior and their report. Experience is private in a way nothing else in nature is.

**Writing guidelines:**

- Don’t write “It’s worth noting that philosophers have identified several key challenges.” Just list the challenges.
- Use the plain-language cashout, not the technical label, as the primary content. The label is a tag, not the substance.
- Don’t preview the solutions. The reader should feel the problems accumulating, not feel reassured.

**Approximate length:** 100–150 words.

### 3.5 The Pivot

**Goal:** One paragraph transitioning from the problem space to IQT. Brief. Promissory. The reader should feel: “okay, I’m listening.”

**Tone:** Shift back to first-person-plural (“this paper”). Slightly more energy. But restrained — don’t oversell.

**Structure:** Something like:

> Every serious theory of consciousness is an attempt to answer some combination of these problems. Most address one or two. None has addressed all four within a single formal framework that also generates concrete, falsifiable experiments.
> 
> This paper proposes that all four problems share a single geometric root: the shape and state of bounded spacetime regions. It identifies a specific mathematical object — already standard in physics — as the thing that consciousness *is*. And it specifies three laboratory protocols, each with pre-registered failure conditions, that could prove it wrong.

**Writing guidelines:**

- The sentence about falsifiable experiments earns its weight because it’s rare in consciousness writing. Don’t bury it. Don’t surround it with qualifiers. State it.
- Don’t use “groundbreaking” or “revolutionary” or “paradigm-shifting.” The claim speaks for itself or it doesn’t.
- No trailing analysis. End the paragraph when the promise is made. Don’t add “…potentially transforming our understanding of the mind-body problem.”

**Approximate length:** 50–80 words.

## 4. What Changes in the Existing Text

### 4.1 Moved, not deleted

Everything currently under the “What is this paper about?” heading, starting from “IQT’s answer is an identity thesis…” onward, remains. It just moves down. The new section sits between the opening hook and “The Big Idea.”

### 4.2 Redundancy check

After the new section is in place, review the existing “What is this paper about?” subsection. Some of its current throat-clearing (“How does the physical matter inside your skull generate the invisible, private feeling…”) will now be redundant since the new section covers that territory more viscerally. Trim or cut those sentences. Don’t let the same ground be covered twice.

### 4.3 Cross-references

The new section plants flags for four problems. Ensure the existing text explicitly picks them up:

- The Hard Problem → §1 “The Big Idea” / QI identity thesis (already there, but worth a callback)
- The Combination Problem → §5 “The Composition Problem” (already there)
- The Subject Selection Problem → mentioned in passing but could use a stronger callback
- The Other Minds Problem / Qualia Inversion → §1 “The Big Idea” / Intrinsicness Principle (implicitly there via algebra-state pair criterion for “same quality,” but could be made explicit)

Consider adding a one-line forward reference at each named problem: “IQT addresses this in Section X” — or, more subtly, pick up the exact language from the problem statement when presenting the solution.

### 4.4 Title adjustment

The section heading “What is this paper about?” is fine for the existing opening hook. The new section needs its own heading. Candidates:

- “Why This Problem Won’t Go Away”
- “The Problem You Already Have”
- “Five Failures”
- Something else — open to suggestions. The heading should be plain and slightly confrontational, not academic.

## 5. Natural-Writing Checklist for the Final Draft

Before finalizing the new section, run through these checks (drawn from the natural-writing skill):

- [ ] **No significance inflation.** Scan for “pivotal,” “profound,” “transformative,” “crucial,” “fundamental” (as an adjective of emphasis rather than a technical term). Delete or replace with concrete detail.
- [ ] **No trailing analysis.** Every sentence should end at its content. No “-ing” phrases that restate what was just said.
- [ ] **No AI vocabulary cluster.** Check for “delve,” “tapestry,” “nuanced,” “multifaceted,” “landscape” (metaphorical), “robust,” “seamless,” “intricate.” Replace with plain words.
- [ ] **Copula check.** Count uses of “is” and “are.” If suspiciously low, you’re oversubstituting with “serves as,” “represents,” “stands as.”
- [ ] **No compulsive triplets.** Lists should vary in length. The five failures are five because there are five distinct failure modes, not because it sounded good.
- [ ] **Em dash restraint.** One per paragraph maximum. Use commas and parentheses for variety.
- [ ] **No preamble throat-clearing.** Delete “It’s important to note,” “It’s worth mentioning,” “It should be noted.”
- [ ] **No summaries of what was just said.** The section should end at the pivot, not with a recap.
- [ ] **Sentence variety.** Mix long and short. Use fragments for emphasis. Let some sentences run. Break the medium-declarative monotone.
- [ ] **Specificity over abstraction.** “Hundreds of millions of animals” not “a staggering number.” “There is no test” not “the epistemological barrier remains.”

## 6. What This Section Must NOT Do

- **Don’t preview the solutions.** The problems accumulate. The reader feels the weight. The pivot promises help. The help comes later.
- **Don’t cite sources in the new section.** Nagel, Chalmers, etc. are background for the author, not content for the reader. The reader shouldn’t feel like they’re in a seminar. They should feel like they’re stuck.
- **Don’t use the word “consciousness” more than necessary.** The five failures are most powerful when they avoid the word and instead point at the thing itself: “the experience of seeing it,” “the thing that is happening to you.” The word “consciousness” is a label that lets the reader off the hook. Make them deal with the unlabeled thing.
- **Don’t be clever.** No wordplay, no jokes, no rhetorical flourishes designed to show the author is smart. The section’s power comes from the reader’s own failure, not from the author’s performance.
- **Don’t apologize or hedge.** Don’t write “these are famously difficult problems” or “philosophers have long struggled with…” The reader just struggled with them. They know.

-----

## 7. Estimated Impact

**Before:** The reader arrives at “consciousness is the algebra-state pair” without having earned the need for an answer. The theory feels like a solution in search of a problem.

**After:** The reader has personally failed to define, locate, measure, explain, or deny their own experience. They’ve seen that comparing experiences is impossible in principle. They know that real lives depend on answers nobody has. They’ve seen the four named problems stacking up. And *then* they hear: “this paper proposes a single geometric root and three experiments.” They’re ready.

The new section adds roughly 500–700 words. The existing document is ~7,500 words. Net increase of ~7–10%, but the experiential impact on the reader’s willingness to engage with the rest is disproportionately large.

## 8. Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Should the “five failures” section have a heading, or just flow?** A heading signals “new section, pay attention.” No heading lets it sneak up on the reader. The sneaking-up might be more effective.
1. **Qualia inversion object:** tomato (red) is the classic. Worth using something less expected? Counter-argument: the classic is classic for a reason. Don’t be clever (see §6).
1. **Should the named problems (§3.4) use bold labels or just run as prose?** Bold labels make them scannable and create anchors. Prose keeps the momentum. Could go either way.
1. **Where exactly does the existing “What is this paper about?” subsection start after the new material?** Need to identify the precise splice point and trim any redundancy.
1. **Should we carry forward any of the existing “What is this paper about?” language into the new section?** The line “How does the physical matter inside your skull generate the invisible, private feeling of having an experience?” is good, but it may now be redundant with the five failures. Check during editing.
