# PDN v3 Task Index

## Order
1. `tasks/todo/01-phase-0-lock-scope.md`
2. `tasks/todo/02-phase-1-architecture-parity.md`
3. `tasks/todo/03-phase-2-evaluation-and-protocols.md`
4. `tasks/todo/04-phase-3-distillation-parity.md`
5. `tasks/todo/05-phase-4-embodied-grounding.md`
6. `tasks/todo/06-phase-5-scale-up-and-infra.md`
7. `tasks/todo/07-definition-of-done.md`

## Dependencies
- Phase 0 is required before anything else (hard constraints + checklist + tests).
- Phase 1 is required before Phase 4 (embodied grounding needs action/control path).
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 only where protocols require new architectural hooks.
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 insofar as narrator/report interfaces change.
- Phase 5 depends on Phases 1-3 being stable enough to scale without churn.

## Status
- [x] Phase 0
- [x] Phase 1
- [ ] Phase 2
- [ ] Phase 3
- [ ] Phase 4
- [ ] Phase 5
- [ ] Done Criteria Met
