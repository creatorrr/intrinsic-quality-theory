## 0) One-page version

### 0.1 Canonical formulation (new)

> **There is only quality.**
>
> **QI (Quality Identity):** the intrinsic quality of a bounded spacetime region is identical to its local algebra–state pair (up to physically induced isomorphism).
>
> What the draft currently calls **Level 1** and **Level 2** are not additional ontological layers. They are **filters**—structural predicates applied to the same substrate (quality).
>
> - **Persistence filter (self-maintenance + invariance):** selects regions whose quality is *self-maintaining* and *dynamically invariant* across time/perturbation—i.e., the region’s future depends materially on its own past (not merely boundary conditions), and it actively sustains a recognizable regime.
> - **Narrative filter (finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression):** selects regions whose quality contains a sub-structure that (i) has finite representational bandwidth, (ii) faces causal asymmetry (traces of past, not of future), and therefore (iii) performs lossy temporal compression—yielding a *self-model* (“I”) as a byproduct.
>
> **Experiencer ≡ experience:** “the experiencer” is not a separate bearer that *has* quality. The experience is the quality. The “self/subject” is a compression artifact generated within certain kinds of quality.

### 0.2 What changes (and what doesn’t)

**Changes (interpretation + language):**
- Replace “three levels of consciousness” framing with “three filters on quality.”
- Remove grammar that reintroduces a subject/bearer (“system becomes an experiencer,” “has experience”).
- Recast persistence in terms of **self-maintenance and invariance** (homeostatic / attractor-like stability; non-equilibrium self-sustaining regimes). (Jeremy England’s broader program is a useful pointing reference here: self-maintenance in driven matter, not a required dependency.)
- Explain the *felt* subject as emerging from **finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression**, rather than as an entity discovered by narration.

**Doesn’t change (math + empirical program):**
- Constraint argument, Intrinsicness principle, QI.
- Formal architecture (algebras/states, restriction maps, nesting, composition).
- Democracy of diamonds.
- Protocols: predictions, metrics, falsification conditions.

## 1) Summary of the revision

The current draft sometimes reads as if **Quality → Experience → Report** are ontological promotions (a system *becomes a new kind of thing* at Level 1, then again at Level 2). This RFC proposes a tighter metaphysics that matches the spirit of QI:

1. **Quality is fundamental and ubiquitous** (every bounded region has an algebra–state pair, hence quality under QI).
2. “Experience” and “experiencer” are not two objects. They are the same object described at different narrative resolutions.
3. Level 1 and Level 2 are best treated as **filters**—ways of selecting structurally special kinds of quality—rather than tiers of being.

This is a *reinterpretation*, not a rewrite of the experimental program. The protocols remain intact; we just change what we say they are measuring.

---

## 2) Core commitments (explicit)

### 2.1 QI without a bearer

QI already does the heavy lifting, but the paper should say this plainly:

- QI does **not** imply “a subject that has quality.”
- QI implies “the region’s intrinsic nature *is* quality.”

So the metaphysical default should be: **no hidden owner of experience** is required.

### 2.2 Filter interpretation of the hierarchy

Replace “levels” with “filters”:

- **Filter 0 (Universality):** all bounded regions have quality.
- **Filter 1 (Persistence = self-maintenance + invariance):** selects regions whose quality is dynamically self-sustaining and robust.
- **Filter 2 (Narration = finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression):** selects regions whose quality contains a self-modeling compression operator.
- **(Optional) Filter 3 (Report/readout dominance):** selects narrated regions whose self-model has dominant readout access to behavior/report channels.

This preserves the paper’s practical structure while preventing an accidental “ontological ladder.”

---

### 2.3 Phenomenality at Filter 0 (the panpsychism question)

The filter framing can accidentally hide a key consequence of QI, so it’s worth stating it explicitly:

- Under **QI**, *quality is not a merely structural/dispositional placeholder*. It is the region’s **intrinsic character**.
- Because **Filter 0 is universal**, *every* bounded region has such intrinsic character.

If you’re willing to use “phenomenal” in the **thin** sense (“what it is” intrinsically), then **yes**: a rock’s quality is phenomenal in a minimal sense.

But this does **not** entail that a rock is “conscious,” “sentient,” or “having experiences” in the ordinary sense. Those terms track higher filters:

- **Experience-structured** (Filter 1) requires self-maintenance + invariance across time/perturbation.
- **Subjective / self-model** (Filter 2) requires finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression.

So the clean slogan is:

> **Phenomenality is ubiquitous (by QI); familiar consciousness is filter-relative.**

This is the crux of the “panpsychism” pushback. You can’t dodge it by wording: either you bite the bullet (quality everywhere) or you abandon QI’s claim to dissolve the hard problem at the base. The right move is to *own the distinction*:
- “phenomenal” = intrinsic character (Filter 0),
- “what-it-is-like-for” = subject-indexed phenomenology (Filter 1+; especially Filter 2).

Practical writing note for the Gentle Introduction: avoid saying “rocks experience.” Say:
- “rocks have quality (intrinsic character),”
- “they do not have persistent self-maintaining regimes or narrators, so they are not conscious.”


## 3) Motivation (why this is worth doing)

### 3.1 The current framing smuggles a subject back in

Phrases like:
- “it becomes an experiencer,”
- “a self-thread is the subject,”
- “the narrative operator routes the subject’s experience,”

invite a silent bearer—exactly what QI is trying to remove.

If quality is the algebra–state pair, then introducing “the experiencer” as an extra entity is a conceptual relapse: property dualism in disguise.

### 3.2 The identity move should dissolve the *who*, not just the *how*

QI collapses the physics/phenomenology gap. But if the draft keeps an implicit “who experiences?” object, the hard problem reappears as “subjecthood.”

This RFC makes the subject question dissolve too:

- **No subject is required for quality to be experience-structured.**
- **Subjecthood is what certain kinds of quality look like from inside a finite-bandwidth compression loop.**

---

## 4) Revised conceptual definitions

### 4.1 Quality (unchanged)

**Quality** = the intrinsic nature of a bounded region, identified (QI) with its local algebra–state pair up to physically induced isomorphism.

### 4.2 Persistence filter (updated): self-maintenance + invariance

Replace “persistence” as a vague continuity condition with a sharper structural target:

A region passes the **persistence filter** when its quality exhibits:

1. **Self-maintenance:** the region sustains its dynamical regime via internal causal organization (its next-state depends materially on its own past-state, not merely on external boundary forcing).
2. **Invariance/robustness:** the sustained regime is stable under perturbation within some basin (homeostasis / attractor-like behavior / error-correcting dynamics).

This is the intuition behind “a candle flame vs a shadow,” but framed to avoid ontological promotion:

- Flame: a self-maintaining regime with invariance properties.
- Shadow: a boundary-driven pattern with little/no autonomous maintenance.

**Note:** Jeremy England’s work is a useful *pointer* toward how self-maintenance can arise in driven physical systems (dissipation/organization in nonequilibrium matter). The RFC does not require committing to any specific England thesis; it’s an analogy for the *kind* of structural predicate we want Filter 1 to track.

### 4.3 Narrative filter (updated): finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression

A region passes the **narrative filter** when its quality includes a sub-structure (call it **N**) with these features:

1. **Finite bandwidth:** N cannot represent the full microstate trajectory of its containing region.
2. **Causal asymmetry:** N has access to present quality + traces of past quality (memory, lingering neural activation, environmental records) but not to future quality.
3. **Compression:** under (1) and (2), N performs lossy temporal compression—binding a succession of quality-slices into a tractable model.

**Result:** N generates a self-model (“I”) as a compression handle for the trajectory.

Crucially: **N does not discover a pre-existing subject**. It *constructs* subjecthood because that’s an efficient representation under finite bandwidth and causal asymmetry.

### 4.4 Report / readout dominance (mostly unchanged)

Where the paper uses “Level 2 = reportable consciousness,” keep the operational idea but reframe:

- “report” is a special case where the narrative model has **dominant access** to output channels.
- reportability is a property of routing/readout, not a new ontological ingredient.

---

## 5) Where the illusion of a separate experiencer comes from (rewritten)

A narrated region contains a narrator with a **specious present** (a finite temporal window). Inside that window:

- Present quality is vivid.
- Very recent quality appears as fading traces.
- Future quality is absent.

Given finite bandwidth, the narrator compresses the trajectory and produces a stable pointer: **“me.”**

From the narrator’s standpoint, this yields the natural but misleading story:

- “There is an I that *had* those past experiences.”
- “There is an I that *will have* future experiences.”

On the filter view:

- there is only quality-at-t, quality-at-(t−Δ), etc.
- the “I” is the narrator’s compression index over that sequence.

**Thesis punchline:** *the experiencer is not an extra thing behind experience; it is the narrator’s model of a temporally extended pattern of quality.*

(And yes: this fits the “subject is born from loss” intuition—without fading/traces and limited bandwidth, there is less pressure to posit a persisting subject-pointer.)

## 6) Section-by-section edits (concrete)

### 6.1 Gentle Introduction

**Retitle suggestion:**
- From: “Three Levels: Why Rocks Aren’t Conscious (But They Do Have Quality)”
- To: “Three Filters: Why Rocks Aren’t Conscious (But They Do Have Quality)”

**Drop-in language replacements:**

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| “becomes an experiencer” | “its quality passes the persistence filter” / “it exhibits self-maintaining, invariant quality” |
| “has experience” | “is experience-structured” / “is experiential in structure” |
| “the experiencer” (noun) | “the region’s persistent quality” / “the persistent regime” |
| “Level 1 system” | “persistent region” |
| “Level 2 system” | “narrated region” |

**Candle/shadow analogy:** keep it, but explicitly disallow ontological promotion.

### 6.2 Section 1 (Core thesis)

**§1.4 (QI justification):**
- Add an explicit “no bearer” paragraph:
  - quality is not a property *of* a subject;
  - the region is intrinsically quality-as-such.

**§1.5–1.6 (Level transitions):**
- Rewrite as filter definitions:
  - Filter 1 = self-maintenance + invariance (persistence)
  - Filter 2 = finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression (narration)

### 6.3 Section 2 (Formal architecture)

**§2.5 (Democracy of diamonds):**
- Strengthen: “which diamonds contain experiencers?” becomes ill-posed.
- The live question becomes: “which diamonds’ quality passes which filters?”

**§2.7 (Temporal phenomenology):**
- Insert the finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression story.
- Optional thought experiment:
  - a narrator with infinite bandwidth and symmetric access to the trajectory would not need a subject-pointer in the same way.

### 6.4 Section 3 (Composition)

No math changes needed.

Optional interpretive note:
- The presheaf-like assignment of quality to every diamond already fits the filter view naturally: filters pick out subfamilies of sections of interest.

### 6.5 Section 4 (Classic problems)

**Mary:**
- Replace “Mary gains a new experience” with “her visual subsystem enters a previously uninstantiated algebra–state regime; the narrator compresses this as ‘I see red for the first time.’”

**Split brain:**
- Replace “self-threads decouple” with “correlation structure changes; narrators’ self-models become stale/inaccurate.”

**Subject selection:**
- Upgrade the dissolution:
  - not “too many candidates,”
  - but “subject is a narrator construct; the only primitive is quality.”

**Narrative operator (key rewrite):**
- N does not operate on a separate self-thread.
- N is quality-about-quality: a subregion whose quality functions as a compressed model of its containing region’s quality trajectory.

### 6.6 Section 5 (Protocols)

Keep protocols intact; swap interpretation:

- **Anesthesia:** you’re measuring degradation of self-maintaining/invariant structure (Filter 1), not “regions losing experiencers.”
- **Overlap:** you’re observing multiple overlapping regions whose quality independently satisfies the persistence predicate.
- **Psychedelics:** you’re perturbing the temporal/compressional structure of narrated quality (Filter 2), shifting effective temporal geometry.

---

## 7) Terminology pass (global)

| Current term | Replacement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| “experiencer” (noun) | Avoid or use in scare quotes | Don’t reify a bearer |
| “Level 1 / Level 2” | “persistence filter / narrative filter” | Filters, not tiers |
| “becomes an experiencer” | “passes Filter 1” | No ontological promotion |
| “has experience” | “is experience-structured” | Remove possessor grammar |
| “subject” | “self-model / subject-construct” | Subject is model output |
| “self-thread” | Keep, but define as pattern | Pattern, not entity |

---

## 8) Relation to other frameworks (updated notes)

- **Russellian monism:** the filter view makes IQT feel less like “proto-phenomenal stuff that combines” and more like “quality everywhere; special structure explains familiar phenomenology.”
- **IIT:** IIT’s exclusion postulate looks like an answer to a question IQT rejects (“which entity is *the* experiencer?”). Under filters, there may be many overlapping narrated/persistent regions.
- **Process philosophy / Whitehead:** resonance increases: the fundamental units are events/occasions (qualities of regions), not enduring subjects that own them.

---

## 9) Open problems (tightened)

### 9.1 Formalizing self-maintenance + invariance (Filter 1)

We should define at least one candidate formalization (even if it’s provisional), e.g.:

- a conditional mutual-information persistence measure;
- a nonequilibrium steady-state / attractor basin criterion;
- a control-theoretic autonomy metric (internal feedback sustaining regime).

The point is not to pick the One True Definition now, but to explicitly align “persistence” with the *kind* of predicate we mean.

### 9.2 The narrator fixed-point problem (Filter 2) — constrained by the narrative filter

The earlier “quality that models quality” phrasing can sound mystifying. Under the **Filter 2** definition, the reflexive loop is *already constrained* by three boundary conditions:

1. **Finite bandwidth:** N cannot represent (or store) the full microstate trajectory of its containing region.
2. **Causal asymmetry:** N updates from present inputs + past traces, not from future states (it is an *online* estimator).
3. **Compression:** under (1) and (2), N produces a lossy summary (belief/self-model state) that is sufficient *for the purposes it serves*—prediction, control, and report-routing.

With those constraints in place, the “fixed-point problem” becomes a better-specified **self-consistency condition**:

> Find a subregion **N ⊂ D** that implements a causal compression map from D’s observable/interface history into a low-dimensional self-model state, such that when N is *embedded back into D* (and coupled through action/output), the trajectories generated in D remain consistent with that compression—i.e., N’s own compressed output continues to be an adequate summary of the dynamics that generate N’s inputs.

Informally: the self-model must be **stable under the closed loop it helps create**.

This is still nontrivial (existence vs nonexistence, uniqueness vs multiplicity, bifurcations under perturbation, and the possibility of competing N-like solutions in overlapping regions). But the narrative-filter constraints do real work: they shrink the fixed-point search space by ruling out degenerate “solutions” (infinite memory, acausal peeking, lossless mirroring of the whole). They are not just descriptors—they are **boundary conditions on the self-referential loop**.

What we want from the longer paper (likely §7 / Open Problems) is at least one candidate formal test: given a candidate partition of a brain-scale diamond, when does a subdiamond qualify as such a self-consistent N, and when do multiple competing solutions appear?
### 9.3 Multiple narrators and overlap phenomenology

Can two overlapping regions each host an N-like structure, yielding partially overlapping subject-constructs? If yes:

- what would the overlap zone feel like?
- is there a principled prediction for when overlap collapses into one dominant narrator?

---

## 10) Suggested revision order (practical)

1. Rewrite §1.4–1.6 as filters (core metaphysics).
2. Rewrite §4.5 (narrative operator) to “quality-about-quality.”
3. Update §2.7 (temporal phenomenology) with bandwidth/asymmetry/compression.
4. Do the language sweep (remove bearer grammar).
5. Light-touch updates to §4.1–4.3 and §5 protocol interpretations.
6. Add Open Problems §9.1–9.3.
7. Revise Gentle Introduction last, once terminology stabilizes.

## 11) What gets riskier (communication hazards) — and mitigation

This revision is philosophically cleaner, but it raises two *predictable* reader-failure modes. It’s worth planning for them explicitly so the Gentle Introduction doesn’t lose people before they reach the empirical content.

### 11.1 The mouse / pain / “no subject” worry

Many readers will hear “no experiencers” as: “then nobody really feels pain.” That’s the opposite of the intended claim.

On the filter view:

- The mouse’s **persistent, self-maintaining** regime (Filter 1) can be pain-structured.
- “The sufferer” is not an extra metaphysical owner; it’s a **self-model handle** (Filter 2) that some systems generate.
- Moral urgency should track *pain-structured dynamics and avoidance behavior*, not the existence of an extra ontological bearer.

Suggested one-liner for the Gentle Introduction:

> “Mice really feel pain; IQT’s claim is just that pain doesn’t need an extra inner witness behind it.”

### 11.2 Accessibility: readers who bounce off “there are no experiencers”

Even sympathetic readers may interpret “no experiencers” as eliminativism, nihilism, or a word game. The best mitigation is rhetorical sequencing:

1. Start with the **non-threatening** claim: *no extra inner witness is required* (self is a model, like many other compressive models in cognition).
2. Only later cash it out in the **strong** form: “experiencer” is not fundamental furniture; it’s a compression artifact.
3. Use “What we are NOT saying” guardrails early:
   - not denying consciousness,
   - not denying suffering,
   - not claiming “everything is conscious,”
   - not claiming ethics evaporates.

Concrete phrasing that tends to survive lay interpretation:

- “The self is a model the brain constructs to track a trajectory; it’s real as a pattern, not as a separate entity.”
- “Experience is what certain physical regimes *are*, not something owned by a ghostly subject.”

The RFC can remain technical, but the *plan* should be visible here so the downstream rewrite (Gentle Introduction) has explicit marching orders.

## 12) Quick checklist for the edit pass

- [ ] No sentence implies a bearer (“the experiencer”) that is distinct from quality.
- [ ] “Levels” are described as filters/predicates, not ontological promotions.
- [ ] Filter 1 explicitly targets self-maintenance + invariance.
- [ ] Filter 2 explicitly targets finite bandwidth + causal asymmetry + compression.
- [ ] Narrative operator is framed as quality-about-quality, not a homunculus.
- [ ] Protocols are unchanged in predictions/metrics, only reinterpreted.
