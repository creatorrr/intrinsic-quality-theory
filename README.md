# Intrinsic Quality Theory

**A Geometric Theory of Phenomenal Experience**

## What if consciousness isn't something brains produce?

Most theories of consciousness try to explain how subjective experience *emerges* from physical processes — how the right arrangement of neurons somehow generates the feeling of seeing red, or the ache of a stubbed toe. Intrinsic Quality Theory (IQT) takes a different path. It proposes that phenomenal quality — the "what it's like" of experience — doesn't emerge from physics at all. It **is** physics, seen from the inside.

The core idea: every bounded region of spacetime has a complete physical description — all the measurements you could make inside that region, and all the values those measurements would give you. Physics already has a precise mathematical object for this: the *algebra-state pair* (the set of possible observations, plus the actual state of affairs). IQT's central claim is that this object **is** phenomenal quality. Not "gives rise to," not "correlates with." *Is.* The way "the morning star" and "the evening star" are two descriptions of Venus — physics and phenomenology are two descriptions of the same thing.

This isn't a loose metaphor. The paper shows that if you ask "what properties must the intrinsic nature of a physical region have?", exactly one mathematical object in all of standard physics satisfies every requirement. The algebra-state pair. There is no runner-up.

## The Big Idea in Five Minutes

### 1. Identity, not emergence

IQT doesn't explain how consciousness "arises" from matter. It identifies consciousness with what matter already is, from the inside. The Hard Problem — "why does anything feel like something?" — is dissolved, not solved. There's no gap between structure and feeling because they're the same thing under two descriptions.

### 2. Three levels keep things precise

Not everything is conscious in the way you and I are. IQT distinguishes three levels:

| Level | Name | What it means | Who has it |
|-------|------|---------------|------------|
| **0** | **Quality** | The intrinsic physical state of any bounded spacetime region | Everything — rocks, thermostats, electrons |
| **1** | **Experience** | A quality-stream that persists over time and is causally semi-autonomous | Mice, dogs, probably many animals |
| **2** | **Report** | A self-thread that builds a compressed self-model and controls a readout channel | Humans (and possibly some other species) |

A rock has quality the way everything has a temperature — that doesn't make it hot. Quality at Level 0 is extremely simple and featureless. The interesting questions — "what kinds of systems have *experience*? what does *selfhood* require?" — live at Levels 1 and 2, and those are empirical questions with testable answers.

### 3. Democracy of diamonds — every perspective is real

A "causal diamond" is just a bounded region of spacetime — think of it as a lens capturing everything that happens between two events. Your visual cortex is one diamond. Your whole brain is a larger diamond containing it. A single neuron is a smaller one inside that.

IQT says all of these have quality, simultaneously. The neuron's quality is simple. The whole brain's quality is richer — it includes cross-regional correlations the neuron can't "see." Neither is "the real one." They're different perspectives on the same physical system, like how a city looks different from street level versus from a satellite. Both views are real.

This is *perspectival relativity*: there is no God's-eye view that picks out the "correct" level at which consciousness happens. Multiple overlapping regions bear quality at the same time. IQT calls this the **democracy of diamonds**.

### 4. Time doesn't flow — your narrator's window slides

Why does time *feel* like it passes? IQT's answer: the human brain's effective diamond is spatially wide (~15 cm, the diameter of your brain) but temporally shallow (~100 ms to ~1 second). That geometric shape means your algebra is rich in spatial correlations (wide visual field, distributed body sense) but poor in temporal ones (the present feels instantaneous, the past is gone).

The "flow" of time is what it feels like to be a finite-bandwidth narrator tracking its own trajectory. Your narrative operator can only hold a thin slice of time at once. Each update sheds trailing content and acquires leading content. That sequential shedding-and-acquiring *is* the feeling of passage — not because reality moves, but because your window slides.

This predicts something testable: change the shape of the diamond, and you change the character of temporal experience. Psilocybin widens it (time dilates). Ketamine narrows it (time fragments). DMT flattens it (time dissolves).

### 5. Composition via correlation — no binding glue needed

How do separate brain regions produce unified experience? This is the "combination problem" that haunts every theory of consciousness. IQT's answer: the quality of the whole is not the sum of the parts. The "missing ingredient" is correlation structure — how the parts are statistically and quantum-mechanically entangled with each other.

Knowing the state of Region A and the state of Region B doesn't tell you the state of A+B. The correlations between them carry additional quality that belongs to the whole but not to either part. This isn't a mysterious binding force. It's a mathematical fact about how states on algebras work.

## The Constraint Argument: Why This and Nothing Else

The identification of consciousness with the algebra-state pair isn't pulled from thin air. It comes from a constraint analysis — asking what properties any candidate for "the intrinsic nature of a physical region" must have:

1. **Completeness.** It must fix everything physically true about the region — every measurement outcome, every correlation.
2. **Nesting consistency (isotony).** The nature of a smaller region should be derivable from the nature of any containing region, just by restricting your attention.
3. **Covariance.** It must transform properly under physical symmetries — rotating or translating the region shouldn't change its intrinsic character.
4. **Perspectival completeness.** It must be self-contained, depending on nothing outside the region.

The algebra-state pair is the *unique* object in standard physics satisfying all four. This is a mathematical result, not a philosophical preference. The argument doesn't prove that intrinsic nature is consciousness — that identification is the separate **Quality Identity (QI)** postulate. But it does prove that if you're looking for intrinsic nature, there is exactly one candidate.

QI is justified not as a derivation but as a bet — a bet on the only horse in the race. Its payoff: it generates composition for free, dissolves the subject-selection problem, predicts temporal phenomenology from geometry, and yields three pre-registerable experiments. No other identification currently delivers this.

## From Physics to Brains: The Effective-Theory Bridge

IQT's identity thesis lives at the level of relativistic quantum field theory — scales far below anything a brain scanner can see. Brains are warm, wet, and classical for practical purposes. How do you connect the two?

The same way particle physics does: through effective field theory. A particle physicist doesn't need to solve string theory to predict what a collider measures. They coarse-grain — zoom out from the fundamental description to a simpler one that keeps only what matters at the relevant energy scale. IQT does the same thing for brains. The fundamental algebra gets coarse-grained to an *effective neural algebra* whose generators correspond to things neuroscience actually measures: local field potentials, population firing rates, and their spatiotemporal correlations.

The crucial claim: this effective algebra is still a local algebra in the formal sense. It inherits the structural properties — isotony, covariance, well-defined restriction — that make the identity thesis, perspectival relativity, and the composition story work. So the entire interpretive framework carries over at brain scale. The metrics in the experimental protocols aren't ad hoc proxies — they're computable functionals of a state on a genuine local algebra, just at coarser resolution.

What prevents circularity is that the coarse-graining is constrained by physics (locality, algebraic structure) and instrumentation (what the electrodes physically access), not fitted to results.

## How Would You Test This?

IQT proposes three pre-registerable experimental protocols, each targeting a different aspect of the theory. Each specifies what counts as evidence for and against, with explicit failure conditions.

### Protocol 1: Anesthesia fragments your self-threads room by room

**The question:** Does losing consciousness under anesthesia happen all at once, or module by module?

IQT predicts that propofol doesn't flip a consciousness switch. It disrupts the temporal persistence of self-threads at different rates across brain regions — prefrontal areas decline earliest, primary sensory areas last. The lights don't go out all at once; they go out room by room. At intermediate depths, some modules retain structured activity while others have collapsed, with reduced coherence between them.

**What would prove IQT wrong:** All modules declining in lockstep (within-subject correlation > 0.9 across module pairs) in most subjects, with no partially-fragmented intermediate state.

### Protocol 2: Overlapping brain regions — the decisive experiment

**The question:** Can two brain regions that share physical substrate both sustain independent processing simultaneously?

This is the biggest empirical wedge between IQT and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). Define two overlapping regions in posterior cortex (sharing lateral parietal electrodes). Give each its own cognitive task. Then deliver a tiny electrical pulse (single-pulse electrical stimulation) to one region and see if the response propagates to the other.

IQT predicts **causal containment**: the pulse stays within its region, even while both are independently performing complex tasks. IIT's exclusion postulate predicts the opposite: the pulse should propagate throughout the union, because there's only one conscious complex.

**What would prove IQT wrong:** The electrical pulse reliably propagating across both regions, or the two regions showing anti-correlated switching dynamics (one active only when the other isn't).

### Protocol 3: Psychedelics shift the shape of your "now"

**The question:** Does the multi-scale persistence profile of brain activity track the character of temporal experience?

IQT predicts that the *peak* of the persistence curve (the timescale at which brain activity is most structured) shifts in specific directions under different compounds:
- **Psilocybin** shifts the peak toward longer windows (time dilation — the present feels expanded)
- **Ketamine** shifts the peak toward shorter windows (time fragmentation — experience feels choppy)
- **DMT** flattens the curve entirely (time dissolution — no preferred timescale)
- **Midazolam** (a non-psychedelic sedative, as control) scales the curve vertically without shifting the peak — distinguishing arousal changes from genuine integration-window changes

**What would prove IQT wrong:** No difference in peak position across compounds, or shifts in the wrong direction, or no correlation between the neural metric and self-reported temporal experience.

## How Is This Different?

| | **IQT** | **IIT** (Integrated Information Theory) | **GNW** (Global Neuronal Workspace) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What is consciousness?** | The intrinsic physical state of bounded spacetime regions (algebra-state pair) | Integrated information (Phi) — the irreducible cause-effect structure of a system | Global broadcasting — a representation becomes conscious when it "ignites" and becomes globally accessible |
| **How many conscious regions per brain?** | Many, overlapping simultaneously (democracy of diamonds) | Exactly one — the maximally irreducible complex (exclusion postulate) | One workspace, one stream at a time |
| **Composition** | Correlation structure is the glue — a mathematical fact, not a special mechanism | Phi measure + exclusion selects the single conscious whole | Sidesteps the problem (consciousness = access, not a compositional property) |
| **Temporal experience** | Predicted from diamond geometry — the shape of the region determines the character of time | No specific mechanism for temporal phenomenology | Explained through workspace dynamics, but no structural account of *why* it feels like passage |
| **Testability** | Three pre-registered protocols with explicit failure conditions at each theoretical layer | Difficult — computing Phi is intractable for biologically realistic systems | Extensively tested via "ignition" paradigms, but hard to distinguish "describes report" from "explains consciousness" |
| **The Hard Problem** | Dissolved by identity — there's no gap to bridge | Addressed by axioms (consciousness = integrated information by postulate) | Not directly addressed — focuses on functional access |

The deepest divergence from IIT is on **overlap**: IIT says only one region per brain can be conscious. IQT says many overlapping regions are, simultaneously. Protocol 2 is designed to settle this empirically.

IQT treats GNW and higher-order theories as *correct about Level 2* — they accurately describe how the narrative self works and how report happens — but *silent about Levels 0 and 1*. The global workspace is the readout mechanism, not the origin of quality.

## Where You Can Disagree (The Skeptic's Map)

IQT is built in layers. You can reject a later layer while keeping earlier ones. Here's where different critical positions live:

**"I reject the Quality Identity (QI)."** You can still take the constraint argument as a novel characterization of "intrinsic nature" in algebraic quantum field theory. The formalism stands as a contribution to the metaphysics of local physics, independent of consciousness. You are a property dualist. Cost: you need a separate composition principle for phenomenal properties, a separate explanation for temporal phenomenology, and a separate account of subject selection — three things QI gets for free.

**"I accept QI but want an exclusion principle."** You accept that quality is the algebra-state pair but insist only one region per brain bears consciousness. You're essentially doing IIT with a different ontology. Protocol 2 is designed to adjudicate between your position and democracy.

**"I accept QI and democracy but doubt the narrative operator (N)."** You accept overlapping diamonds bearing quality but doubt that the narrative-operator framework correctly links quality to reportable experience. The empirical predictions of the protocols are what fail for you, not the ontology. The bridge hypotheses are the most revisable component of the theory.

**"I accept everything but doubt the effective-theory bridge."** You think the jump from algebraic QFT to neural-scale metrics is too large. Fair — the paper flags this as an open problem. The protocols test the effective-level predictions; the fundamental-to-effective bridge is a separate research program.

## Status and Open Problems

This is **Draft v1.6** — mature enough for concrete experiments, but with open problems across three fronts:

**Mathematical:** The boundary data problem (what minimal information determines a diamond's quality from boundary conditions). The presheaf cohomology conjecture (whether quality is locally determined). Rigorous construction of AQFT on causal sets.

**Computational:** A biophysically realistic narrative operator (neural-field model, not the toy 6-qubit pipeline). Tractable approximations of the unity functional for realistic system sizes. Efficient Phi surrogates for direct comparison with IIT.

**Empirical:** Execution of the three protocols. Priority: Protocol 1 (anesthesia — most straightforward clinical logistics) and Protocol 2 (overlap — the decisive IIT contrast, requires intracranial EEG patients).

**Collaboration sought** with clinical anesthesiology groups, epilepsy surgery teams (for iEEG access), and psychedelic research labs. If any of this is your world, reach out.
