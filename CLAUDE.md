## Writing Style

All prose in this repository (introductions, documentation, READMEs) should follow the natural-writing skill guidelines.

See: [.claude/skills/natural-writing/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/natural-writing/SKILL.md)

Key principles:
- Cut significance inflation — state facts, let readers judge importance
- Kill trailing analysis — end sentences at the fact
- Avoid AI vocabulary clusters (delve, tapestry, multifaceted, nuanced, etc.)
- Use "is" and "are" instead of "serves as," "stands as," "represents"
- Drop negative parallelisms ("not only... but also")
- Break the compulsive rule of three
- Stop elegant variation — repeat the word if it's the right word
- Restrain em dashes — one per paragraph max
- Cut "it's important to note" and similar throat-clearing
- Don't summarize what you just said
- Vary sentence architecture
